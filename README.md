# Music Quizzical

From OCR 2019 Projects Task 1, this is a command line quiz I made mostly in school.

However, since then I've added a couple features not in the original task and made a few changes:
+multiple genres (with easy ability to add more)
+removes songs from the available pool to avoid duplicate questions
+added hint system that takes points (and means you might not instantly lose if you don't know a song)

The code is quite messy and the inputs require full punctuation but it was one of the first larger projects I made and is actually fairly enjoyable to play.
